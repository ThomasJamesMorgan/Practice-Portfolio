                  <p>Hi, my name's Thomas and I have have been learning to code since October 2023. <br>
                     So far I have been studying and practicing my skills in Python, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. <br>
                     Below I have included samples of some of the projects I have completed using the above skills.
